- years to break even (see notes)
    + need to rethink calculation method? Not ideal...
    + need the output of retain_all, which isn't currently incorporated in nc-result functions
    + maybe incorporate revenue stream in the calculation? (not currently done)
    + alternatively write separate function(s) for this purpose, which can maybe share sub-functions with the current workflow
    + need to use present_value_stream() in lifetime revenue calc
- convert revenue computations to stream (cumulative revenue by year)
    + a decent amount of work, but probably a better approach
- add vignette to README.md
