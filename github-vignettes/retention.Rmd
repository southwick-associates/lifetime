## Retention Overview

Estimating revenue in the annual purchase scenario fundamentally depends upon predicting the number of years a customer will buy licenses in the future. The method presented here uses retention rates (% of buyers in one year who buy licenses in subsequent years). 

### Retention Curves

Retention curves can be constructed from observed retention rates, and these always slope downward. The example below is pulled from the NC report Appendix, and uses linear regression fit to 10 years of observed retention rates for hunters aged 45 in year zero. This vignette walks through the R functions used to estimate such retention curves.

## Data Standardization

The functions in package lifetime expect that license data has been prepared in a way consistent with the structure described in [package salic](https://southwick-associates.github.io/salic/articles/salic.html). Sample data in the salic standard format is provided in this package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lifetime)
data(cust, lic, sale, hunt) # load lifetime sample data
```

```{r}
# standard license data for 100K customers
# - the lic table has an extra field (life_group) identifying the license types of interest
# - for the lifetime pricing analysis
sale %>%
    left_join(lic, by = "lic_id") %>% 
    left_join(cust, by = "cust_id") %>%
    head(2)

# hunting permission history for those 100k customers
head(hunt, 2)
```

## Simple Retention Calculation

The basis of retention is the focus on a "year zero" reference year with known license holders. For example, for year0 = 2008, year1 = 2009, year2 = 2010 (etc), we can pretty easily calculate a retention curve with a custom function:

```{r}
calc_retain <- function(hunt, year0) {
    hunt_year0 <- filter(hunt, year == year0)
    semi_join(hunt, hunt_year0, by = "cust_id") %>% 
        count(year) %>%
        mutate(retain_rate = n / nrow(hunt_year0))
}
calc_retain(hunt, 2008) %>% head(3)
```

Our function doesn't work though if we want to use 2009 for year0. 

```{r}
calc_retain(hunt, 2009) %>% head(3)
```

## Data Preparation

We could modify the above function, but filtering problems can also crop-up in downstream calculations. To streamline filtering customers of interest, package lifetime uses `yrs_zero` preparation functions that incorporate a split operation to separate license history into 2 components: (1) a "year0" customer table used as reference for filtering, and (2) a "history" table for calculating retention.

```{r}
hunt_split <- yrs_zero_split(hunt)
lapply(hunt_split, function(x) head(x, 2))
```

We then use `yrs_zero_filter()` with `yrs_calc_retain` to calculate the 2008 retention curve:

```{r}
hunt_split %>%
    yrs_zero_filter(function(x) filter(x, year == 2008)) %>%
    yrs_calc_retain() %>% 
    head(2)
```

## Retention Calculation

The "split" paradigm is more useful for more complex cases. Say we want to look at those aged 25 to 35, but wish to include all available data possible (year0 = 2008, 2009, ...):

```{r, fig.height=3}
hunt_split <- hunt_split %>% 
    yrs_zero_filter(function(x) filter(x, age_year %in% 25:35))
retain <- yrs_calc_retain(hunt_split)

p <- ggplot(retain, aes(years_since, pct)) + 
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Retention for hunters aged 25 to 35")
p
```

The plot below demonstrates the use of multiple year zeroes with the `yrs_calc_retain()` grouping option. By default, the function will average across all available year zeroes.

```{r, fig.height = 3}
retain_all <- yrs_calc_retain(hunt_split, year0)
p + geom_point(data = retain_all)
```

## Regression Modelling

With license data, we are faced with a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 years) for calculating retention. To extrapolate further we can use a simple regression model. A logarithmic relationship seems to provide a decent fit to the time trend.

```{r}
model_fit <- lm(pct ~ log(years_since), data = retain)
model_fit
```

We can then predict for future years. This is also useful because the sum of retention rates is equal to total future years over a given timeframe (34 years in this example):

```{r}
model_predict <- data.frame(years_since = 1:34)
model_predict$pct <- predict(model_fit, model_predict)
tail(model_predict, 3)
sum(model_predict$pct)
```

## Full Calculation

Package lifetime includes `yrs_result` convenience functions that wrap up the retention modelling steps for analysis. Here we are using the hunting permission data for those aged 25 to 35 to predict future years (till age 64) for 30-year-olds:

```{r, fig.height=4}
hunt_split <- hunt %>%
    yrs_zero_split() %>%
    yrs_zero_filter(function(x) filter(x, age_year %in% 25:35))

estimate_and_plot <- function(hunt_split) {
    observe <- yrs_result_observe(hunt_split, predict_age = 30)
    retain <- yrs_result_retain(hunt_split, predict_age = 30, end_age = 64)
    yrs_plot(retain) + geom_point(data = observe)
}
estimate_and_plot(hunt_split) + ggtitle("Retention curve for 30-year-old hunters")
```

We also might be interested in focusing further. For example on residents who buy the comprehensive license; we use `yrs_lifetime_join()` to flag customers who buy that license type and then exclude customers who don't with `yrs_zero_filter()`:

```{r, fig.height=4}
hunt_split <- hunt %>%
    yrs_lifetime_join(sale, lic, "comp_hunt") %>%
    yrs_zero_split() %>%
    yrs_zero_filter(function(x) {
        # would also likely choose age_year == 30 for actual analysis
        # but the sampled data are too noisy for a nice demonstration
        filter(x, age_year %in% 25:35, res == 1, life_group == "comp_hunt")
    })
estimate_and_plot(hunt_split) +
    ggtitle("Retention for 30-year-old resident comprehensive hunting license buyers")
```
