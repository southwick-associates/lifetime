## Retention Overview

Estimating revenue in the annual purchase scenario fundamentally depends upon predicting the number of years a customer will buy licenses in the future. The method presented here bases these predictions on retention rates (% of buyers in one year who buy licenses in subsequent years). 

### Retention Curves

Retention curves can be constructed from observed retention rates, and these always slope downward. The example below is pulled from the NC report Appendix, and uses a linear regression line fit to 10 years of observed retention rates for hunters aged 45 in year zero. This vignette walks through the R functions used to estimate such retention curves.
