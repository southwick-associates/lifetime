\title{Calculate WSFR Aid dollars by current age}
\usage{
wsfr_annual_stream(retain_all, wsfr_amount, min_amount, senior_price,
  senior_age = 65, age_cutoff = 80)

wsfr_lifetime_stream(prices, wsfr_amount, min_amount, age_cutoff = 80)

wsfr_lifetime(prices, wsfr_amount, min_amount, age_cutoff = 80)
}
\arguments{
\item{retain_all}{data frame of predicted years by age like that produced by
\code{\link{nc_retain_all}}}

\item{wsfr_amount}{numeric estimated amount for aid dollars (use SFRF for
fishing, WRF for hunting)}

\item{min_amount}{numeric the minimum expenditure that will count for a
certified hunter/angler (use 2 for hunt/fish and 4 for combo)}

\item{senior_price}{numeric price for a senior lifetime license}

\item{senior_age}{numeric age when a participant will be expected to buy
a cheap lifetime license}

\item{age_cutoff}{numeric final age that can be counted for lifetime
license-based WSFR dollars}

\item{prices}{data frame of lifetime prices by age with at least
2 variables: current_age and price_lifetime}
}
\description{
Estimated aid dollars are determined differently for the annual vs. lifetime
purchasing scenarios (see functions section below). Links to a web-based
reference document are included in details below.
}
\details{
These calculations are based on a discussion between Tom, Dan, Eric, and
Patty on 12/10/19. Primarily using
\url{https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/part-80} to highlight a number
of points about WSFR aid predictions for lifetime license sales:
\itemize{
  \item There is an age cutoff of 80 years (in lieu of a life-expectancy-based
  attrition estimate):
  \href{https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/80.35}{section 35} bullet H
  \item It looks like infants can be counted:
  \href{https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/80.33}{section 33} bullet C
  \item The required annual amount is $2 for hunt/fish and $4 for combo:
  \href{https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/80.34}{section 34} bullet A
}
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{wsfr_annual_stream}: Stream of WSFR Aid for annual license scenario

This depends largely on the estimated number of years a license buyers will
participate in the future. It also assumes by default that any remaining
participants will buy a lifetime license at senior_age. The stream calculation
forcasts aid for relevant future years.
